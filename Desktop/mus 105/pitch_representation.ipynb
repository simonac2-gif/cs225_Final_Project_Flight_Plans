This dilemma was the source for many interesting and beautiful tuning systems developed over the centuries. All of these system are ingenious ways to distribute the \"error\" across the total gamut of the tuning's pitches so that we hear some perfectly just intervals and don't notice the errors in the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarter Comma Mean Tone Tuning was very successful:  tune four 5ths a bit flat so that major thirds can be made perfect (5/4) and minor thirds almost perfect. The result was a tuning with sweet natural sounding thirds. But since the error was distibuted over 5ths, it meant the further out you went from those keys, the more those intervals were mistuned.\n",

    "### Twelve Tone Equal-Temperent (TET)\n",
    "\n",
    "TET-tuning is the product of over a thousand years of musical exploration by composers, performers and theorists.  Instead of trying to keep certain intervals 'just', TET tunes the smallest interval (half-step) to 1/12 of an octave so that 12 of them fit exactly within an octave. This means that in TET tuning **no** interval is 'just' except for the octave. This is a very different approach than all the earlier tuning systems! \n",
    "\n",
    "TET tuning creates a *scale* by assigning a pitch (A4) to the frequency 440 Hertz. Given the frequency of that one note, all the other frequencies in the scale can be derived by TET's simple mathematical formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because TET standardizes all intervals -- and hence notes -- pitch information can be viewed from a number of different perspectives and mapped (converted) between different but equivalent representations. Here is a list of different pitch information that we will be working with this semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hertz frequency, or cycles per second. For the purposes of MUS105 a hertz value is an integer or floating point number ranging from 0.0 to infinity. Examples: A440 is 440 Hz and middle C is 261.625 Hz.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pitch names. A pitch name consists of three elements: a letter, an optional accidental, and an octave. For the purposes of MUS105 a pitch is a string whose letter is an upper or lower-case version of ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'); an optional accidental double-flat ('bb' or 'ff'), flat ('b' or 'f'), natural (''), sharp ('#' or 's'), double-sharp ('##' or 'ss'); and an octave ('00', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'). Examples: A440 is 'A4' and middle C is 'C4'. The names 'B#3' and 'Dbb4' are enharmonic spellings of 'C4'. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. MIDI key numbers. For the purposes of MUS105, MIDI key numbers are integers ranging from 0 to 127 inclusive. Examples: A440 is MIDI key number 69 and middle C is key number 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pitch classes. PCs are integers ranging from 0 to 11. Each PC represents the ordinal position of a pitch in the TET scale without regard to octaves or pitch spelling.  Examples: PC 0 represents any key or pitch name that is some octave multiple of 'C': e.g. 60, 72, 'C3', 'C5', 'B#4', 'Dbb8',  and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Pitch class names. For the purposes of MUS105 these are pitch names without the octave: 'Bb', 'C', 'F#'.  Every pitch class name can be mapped to an integer pitch class."

We think of octaves as being the 'same pitch' because every harmonic of the higher note will align with a harmonic of the lower tone. In some sense, then, we only have 12 distinctly different notes and all the rest are octaves.  \n",

Middle C is key number 60, the start of the 4th octave on the piano, so MIDI octave are numbered -1 to 9 so that middle C remains the start of octave 4 in both systems. Since -1 seems like strange name for an octave the lowest octave is often named '00'.\n",

    "While midi has 40 more notes than the piano, most of these extra notes are not musically viable. The reason that MIDI has more pitches has nothing to do with music, but is due to the numerical representation of notes in MIDI (more about this in the second half of the course.) For example, the lowest MIDI pitch (C00) is 8.275 Hz, well below the threshold of human hearing, which ranges from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (and degrades towards the extremes).  The highest note on the piano is C8, which is also the top note of the piccolo, the highest instrument in western music. So the piano keyboard is still the best approximation for representing sounds that are musically viable for humans to perform and listen to."

    "To convert a midi key number into a pitch name you map the integer into three different strings: a pitch letter, an accidental and an octave number. The easiest way to map an integer to a string is to use a list or a dictionary. For a list (see above) you use the integer as an *index* into the list of strings. If you use a dictionary, each key could be an integer and the pitch name string would be its associated value in the dictionary. \n",

For example, key number 61 maps to 'B##3', 'C#4, and 'Db4'.  To return a pitch name, then, really requires the code to determine *which* pitch name to return.  One solution might to return the \"simplest\" spelling, e.g. a spelling that prefers natural over a single sharp or flat (and never choosing double sharps or flats) and using the spelling that comes from the earliest key signature in which that spelling first appears. Using this logic, key number 61 would map to 'C#4' because the 'C#' first occurs in a key signature with 2 sharps whereas the 'Db' spelling first appears in a signature with 4 flats. A more flexible solution would be to return the \"simplest\" accidental as a default but to allow the user to override it, and signal an error if user's choice cannot be satisfied (for example, asking for key number 61 to be spelled as a double flat.)"
