# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 


We will meet about once a week every friday or saturday evening at the CIF. If we cannot be present in person we will utilize discord to communicate. I(simon) will record start to end time with a stopwatch.
2. **Assistance** 
 
 
 We will contact each other via DM since that goes to our phone directly and will at least exhibit a buzz if our phone is silenced(not off). We should be expected to respond within a 1-3hr time period from time message was sent.

3. **Respect** 


I will be sure everyone has a say in a matter before a primary decision is made in every aspect of the project. Any concerns about would need to be addressed right away. A prime example would be to call for a consensous before doing something as a group like adding a helper function etc...

## Collaboration


4. **Work Distribution** 

I would give each person a role based on dividing the project into 3 aspects. I would assign based on our particular strengths and weakness in cs2225. Complications will be addressed right away and might even involve simplifying or cutting some functions to adjust accordingly.

5. **Time Commitment** 


Currently we plan to have 1-2 hour weekly work put in to the project per person, though at the end of the day time length will vary depending on how many difficulties we individually encounter. It would be nice to find a way to evenly space out things per day. However on days that time commitments are heavy such as events, projects and exams to prepare for etc.... we will expect each other to pick just one time slot to put 100% focus with delievering. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
How will the team resolve situations where there is a disagreement between members? Situations where one or more members have not accomplished their tasks? Situations where one or more members are habitually late? Are there other hypothetical situations that you as an individual or as a team want to discuss ahead of time? When issues occur, you are strongly encouraged to inform course staff, but only after first trying to resolve the issue as a team in a respectful manner.

It is understandable that many of us will have plenty of busy work outside of cs225. We plan to use consistent communication to be forewarned of any difficulties impending. Our goal is to have the project completed at least a week before its due date.. preferably over thanksgiving break if we are lucky.
